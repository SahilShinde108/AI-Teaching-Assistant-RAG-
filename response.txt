So, you want to know when CSS basics are covered in our course.

CSS basics are actually covered twice in different videos!

In Video 2 (at timestamp: 850.44 seconds), we briefly mention the basics of CSS right after explaining how I will teach you CSS.

However, a more detailed explanation of CSS basics is found in Video 1, when it says "we will learn html, css, javascript" at the end, around 1514.24 seconds into that video.

So, if you want to dive deeper into CSS basics, check out Video 2 (the one with the number 2) and look for the timestamp around 850.44 seconds!
