You can find the explanation for the `<code>` and `<pre>` tags in **Video #13**, titled **"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML."**

Here is a quick guide on where to look:

*   **The `<pre>` tag:** The discussion begins around the **2:31** mark (151 seconds), where I explain how to use the pre tag to preserve formatting. I also revisit its usage at **3:05** (184 seconds).
*   **The `<code>` tag:** I introduce and demonstrate the code tag starting at **5:47** (347 seconds).
*   **Combined Usage:** At the **6:23** mark (383 seconds), I show how you can use both the code and pre tags together to display blocks of code effectively.

I recommend heading over to Video #13 to see these tags in action! Let me know if you have any other questions about the course material.
