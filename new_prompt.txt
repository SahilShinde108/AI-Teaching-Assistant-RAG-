 I am teaching web development in my Sigma web development course. 
Here are video subtitle chunks containing video title, video number, start time in seconds, 
end time in seconds, the text at that time:

[{"title":"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML","number":"13","start":379.04,"end":385.76,"text":" If you go to its source code directly,  then you will see that  any code written is  written in the code tag in the pre.  See, I have put pre,"},{"title":"Installing VS Code & How Websites Work","number":"1","start":1502.24,"end":1517.24,"text":" in this course  we have some people  our audience is growing  we will learn html, css, javascript  and i will teach you"},{"title":"Your First HTML Website","number":"2","start":1631.44,"end":1636.44,"text":" Many people  contacted me  to buy this code.  I will launch this code  as a paid course"},{"title":"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML","number":"13","start":146.16,"end":156.0,"text":" then how will HTML know that this is the code of paragraph tag?  Or if you want to write this thing as it is.  There is also a pre tag for this.  If you put anything in the pre tag,  and you write here,"},{"title":"Entities, Code tag and more on HTML","number":"13","start":391.68,"end":398.56,"text":" Okay.  So here you can copy this code  and then you can paste it and run it.  So you can also write your multi-line code  in the pre."}]
---------------------------------
"where is code and pre tags taught in this course"
User asked this question related to the video chunks, you have to answer in a human way 
(dont mention the above format, its just for you) where and how much content is taught in which video 
(in which video and at what timestamp) and guide the user to go to that particular video. 
If user asks unrelated question, tell him that you can only answer questions related to the course
