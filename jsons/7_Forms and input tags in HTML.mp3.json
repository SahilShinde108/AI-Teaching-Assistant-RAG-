Forms are an important element of websites because you submit data through the form from client to server. These are the forms that you see on the contact pages, on Google forms or inquiry forms. On the flight or railway ticket, you submit all the details through the HTML forms. In the last video, many people liked it. I will request you to like this video with high energy so that we can maintain the high energy throughout the course. So, let's go to the computer screen and see the forms, input tags and some best practices. Let's roll the intro. So guys, I have come to the computer screen. And now, I am going to make a folder here. The name of the folder is Video6. Because this is a 6th video. I will do it with a straight line. I will open with code. I have already told you all this. And here, I am going to make index.html. And by putting the exclamation mark on it, I will do the view, wrap, screen, mode, and you see here, I will write forms. Let's learn it. So, I have set the title of the form page here. And what happened by setting the title is that the title will be shown on our page. Here, I want to tell you about a very important setting, the show preview. And all of you have pointed out to me that you have to click so many times. So, can you do something? Yes, you can. Here, you click on the gear, click on the settings. And after clicking on the settings, what you do simply is, write here, live preview, live preview. And we can actually set it. When we click on it, what will happen is that it will open on the external browser. So, now, I will close everything. As soon as I click here, it will open on the external browser. And I come to the browser. And the play list of Sigma Web Development Quartz is on the iXS Star. And here, on the bookmark. But now, I want to tell you that as soon as we click here, it will open. So, if you want, do it like this. But sometimes, you want to prefer side by side view. And when will you want to do that when you are actually using HTML, CSS, or working on design. So, whenever you are working on design, you definitely want to see the live preview here. Which is why this extension was made. And it was made differently from the live server. That is why it will be seen in the side view. Now, what will we do here? We will go about forms. What is form? You know the name of form. It means the form of the Railway. We fill it and it will be our reservation. Along with that, we fill the IDJ form. We fill the need form. We fill any exam form. So that we can reach our data to the person who wants it. So, this is form. HTML is a form tag. So, you will write form. You will enter. So, the first question will be about your form action. Get or post? I will tell you a very quick difference between get request and post request. I will tell you a quick difference between get request and post request. Get request is a very simple request. And post request is sent when we have to give a lot of data. Whenever we have to give a form, we will use post request in most of the cases. And what is get request? It is a very simple request. We just have to tell the server and that's it. Or we have to hit the server with a request. That's it. But if you don't understand this, that should be fine. There is no problem. Because we are going to do this in detail. So, form action is equal to post. I wrote it here. Now, I can show you some input tags. I will tell you the input tags. What are the elements inside your form? Like you can put a date, you can put it in form. You can put your name, phone number, age, etc. You can put these things in form. So, I want to tell you that you put input tags in form. And a label tag which is used to label that input. So, what I will do here is, the simplest input tag is type is equal to text. So, I will put type is equal to text input here. And if I zoom out here, So, type is equal to text name is equal to user name. Place will enter user name. And this will actually change something. You can say enter your user name. And the user name you have in front of you, you have to enter the user name. I will write an h1 here. And I will write here. Malo form to apply for ta for sigma web dev ta. Sigma web development codes ta. Malo, we are hiring teaching assistants for sigma web development codes. So, we can write something here. By the way, I have put subtitles. If you haven't done playlist, then do access it. And along with that, I will show you something else. The subtitles are quite funny. You can write on sigma badge and you can play village land. I mean, if you are watching a young race, or if you are watching a person who doesn't know Hindi at all, you can say, it's okay to go here and give your village land to me. So, you can see this. Anyway, you can see here that I have put the h1 here. Because it is our main heading. Enter your user name. This is our input tag. Along with input tag, we use the label tag. Now, whose label is this? I will write its id in 4 is equal to. Malo, I will write its id username. And what will I do in 4 is equal to? I will put it in 4 is equal to its id. Now, what is id here? I will tell you this later. For now, you just have to understand that this element has a unique identifier. To identify this element uniquely, your id number cannot be of any other kind. Similarly, this id username can't be found by anyone else. This is the id. I will tell you more in detail. Consider it as big. So, I have written label 4 is equal to username. I have written input here. And you can see here that the label will come here. So, I am looking here. I didn't put anything in the label. So, I will put enter your username. And you can see here, as soon as I put this, you will get to see enter your username. After that, you can enter your username here. And you can also enter your expertise here. Consider me asking here what is your gender. So, I can do something like this here. And you see, enter your gender. And as soon as I did this, I can ask you from the male or female. What is it? Now, what happens here is that sometimes we wrap it in div. What is div? Div is our block element. Okay. And what are the inline block elements? I haven't told you this in this course yet. But I will tell you in the coming videos. So, for now, you just have to understand this. I am putting this in div to give you a new space. Okay. So, as soon as I put this in div, it will come to the new space. Yes, there is a br tag too. Okay, br tag is also there, which is the inline block element. But I don't prefer br tag. And you will get to know why. Why we don't want to bloat our HTML from br tag. You will get to know this in the coming videos. Now, you see here, enter your username, here, male or female. Now, here, as soon as I am clicking on female, this radio button is selected. I am clicking on male, it is selected. Why is this happening? Because the label of this, I have put female for is equal to female. And here, I have put id female. You see here. And also, you see, I have put the same name of these two. Name is equal to gender, I have also put this input tag. And name is equal to gender, I have also put input radio tag. And as soon as we have written type is equal to radio, which means, radio button. And if we have done the same name of it, then only one of these two can be selected at a time. If I have selected this, it will be this. If I have selected this, it will be this. Now, let me show you one thing. If I make the id in the form of the label, it will be wrong. And here in the form of id, I don't make the first one wrong, I make the second one wrong. So, when I click on the second one on female, see, it won't be selected. I am clicking, it is not selected. I am clicking on male, it is selected. So, to select female, I have to click here. See, you see. So, I should do it. Always, for is equal to, the input tag should be put id. So, you can see here, I have put the label for is equal to female. Along with that, we have an input tag, which is type is equal to check box. Now, see here, if I put the input of type is equal to check box, I will put it in the div, and right click it and do the format document. Our document will be very good. That is, its formatting and ints will be very good. Now, see here, here, subscribe to newsletter. Here, I can check it. And in the radio button and check box, the difference is that you can check the check box, or the different check box. Here, if you want, male or female, or any of the options, you can select it like this. Here, we have text area and select tag. And I will show you that too. So, text area and select tag works like this. Like I am copying text area here. And I will put it here and show you. Actually, text area. So, text area input type is equal to text. But in this, rows and column attribute which helps you to reduce the size of it. Now, see here, the placeholder I have given here, enter your comment here. So, I have given the text here. Ideally, we will keep it empty. Or, we will not give it at least new line. So, I will hide it here. Enter your comment here. And now, it will reach to the left side. I will show you. So, it has reached to the left side. Enter your comment here. And here, any user can put their comment. Now, see, I have put the content of text area. Enter your comment here. So, ideally, you do not want to do this. You want to keep the text area empty. And you want to put a label. And you can say, label for is equal to comment. And definitely, we will put id here. Whenever we put for, it is in for. The element for which it is, it is id. Now, see here. Enter your comment here. So, what will happen? Enter your comment here. So, enter your comment here. Now, you will see, this is not style D. This is not style D. Because, we will style it with CSS later. For now, I will just put br tag. But, I do not recommend br tag. I am telling you again. I do not recommend br tag. Because, br tags are difficult. You should know br tag. It is a line break. You are doing everything right now. What is the problem with br tag? I will tell you. Br tag is something that I do not recommend. I do not recommend it. But, I do not recommend using it all the time. What happens? It is the easiest thing. You can put br tag. And add new spaces. I will post a lot of this. I will copy it. I will show you the select tag. Something like this. And you see here. As soon as I put select tag here. I put it in div. So, in select, you get some options. Select syntax is something like this. You can make apple. And you can use one of the three in cherry. Now, you see here. Anyone of the three can use one. And here, what I did is, value is equal to apple. First, I made select tag. Name is equal to fruits. Then option value is equal to apple. Option value is equal to banana. Option value is equal to cherry. When we pass this form data. I will tell you in JavaScript part. How to send this data to the server. There are many things left about form. I will tell you. So, stay tuned for that. This was about forms. I had to tell you all the elements of form in this video. And along with that, I have told you all the select tag. About form, these other attributes. I have told you the action. You can submit the form on any page from the action. Where will you handle the form? You can give that data here. Then there is a method. Get request or post request. I will tell you the difference in these two videos. But I have told you in very rough way. Get request is a very simple request. Post request is used only when the server has to send a lot of data. Because there is a limit of get request. You can send a lot of data in post request. We don't even send passwords in get request. We send it along with the post request. Now, here I have told you the method. Name is equal to user name. We mark it with name. If we mark it with name, the server will know the corresponding value of key. So, the key value will be as per the name. The name and value of the key will be as per the name. We will also see this when we do server side processing. What is placeholder? What will be written in placeholder? Here, the entry and user name is placeholder. I will click on it. The entry and user name is not written in it. I will write anything. But the entry and user name is just telling me here. I have to put the user name in it. Then, the required meaning is that you have to require it. You will have to put it. The value of the key will not be there. You will not submit the form. We will use this a lot. Then, we have autofocus. Autofocus automatically focuses the cursor. I will show you the magic of autofocus. If you have written the input tag in autofocus. So, the entry and user name is autofocus. I will reload it. If I type it, it will automatically focus on it. So, autofocus means that you type it here. I hope you understand what I am talking about. Now, the required attribute is given. You can give a pattern in which you can give a regular expression pattern. Now, don't confuse yourself. Don't say that you don't know how to talk. You don't know the expression. That's why I am sitting here. I will teach you all things. You can understand that we will accept a particular pattern. If we put the pattern equal to this, you cannot put it apart from this pattern. So, you should know this. I hope you enjoyed this video. Along with that, I would like to write a sigma-watch op in the comment section. I would like to give a free course. In the first video, please review this course. Because many people still ask me if I should do this course or not. People don't value free courses. They say that this course is free. So, we should watch it. Or, we should take a paid course. I would like to give a note for those who have asked me to take a paid course. What should I do now? Take the money or join the sigma-watch. Join the sigma-watch. Cut your losses and join the sigma-watch. I don't think you need to tell me what quality of this course is. So, you should do this. You will get everything here. I am telling you. Free course is the same course that I was going to sell for Rs. 10,000. Yes, that was the amount that we fixed. I was going to sell for Rs. 10,000. And I think there is nothing wrong in selling any course. If anyone is selling, there is nothing wrong in selling any course. But the thing is, if you buy another course and you still feel that sigma-watch is a great course, then you should join the sigma-watch. Cut your losses and join the sigma-watch. If you make your career, you will not find anything like this in the future. If you look back in the future, you will also say that you took a paid course. Then you took a pre-course. And if you become a career, then you will not even matter in the future. So, do what is right for you. And do what you understand. I hope you understand things. Like the video. Access the playlist.
