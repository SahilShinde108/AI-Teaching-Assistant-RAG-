If you have liked this course, then do like this video. Your likes will help me in getting free courses. In this video, we will make a small project, which will be a bookmark website. This bookmark website will help you in getting all your favorite websites in one place. You will be able to use this in actual use. So let's start quickly. Write down in the comments, sigma batch OP. Let's roll the intro. So guys, as you can see, it has already been matched in the computer screen. And if you haven't accessed the playlist yet, then you can access it. One more thing I want to tell you is that if you go to github.com, you will get the github repo of sigma web dev course. Now I have made all the videos in it in different folders. And the committee is also made in different folders. So you will get it. So you have to access it so that you get the source code. I will put the video in the description as well. So there is no problem. Now we will make a very basic website today. But it will be very important for us because it will be our first useful website. So I will not take much time. I will make a new folder in this sigma web dev folder. And I will name it video4 because it is our fourth video. So I will name it video4. I will click on open with code to open this folder in our vscode. After doing this, I will do the same thing that we always do. Index.html, main.css, style.css and script.js. We usually make these three files. If I write css, I will write here. If I write script, I will write here. But for now, I will just write the exclamation mark here and write it in this way. My bookmarks. Okay, so we are going to make a bookmark website. I will write the code here. So you must have seen the titles like this. Now I will write H1. What happens with H1? You can use H1 to add heading to your web page. We have talked about basic structure. We said that this is HTML page. HTML lang is equal to en, lang is an attribute and its value is en. This page's content is in English. It tells this search engine. Or if anyone is taking this web page link, he will know that this web page is in English. He can parse this web page according to that. The browser will also know that your web page is in English. Now here is the head in which the metadata, title, page, css is linked. All these things are information. The main content is in the body. Now there is a tag to add heading in the body, which is called H1. And I am going to write my bookmarks in it. So if I write my bookmarks here, we will write this H1 tag. And if I want to do it live here, I will click here and then I will open it in the browser. Now look at this, it is showing my bookmarks like this. Now why should we always use H1? Why didn't I write my bookmarks directly? Because I am telling the browser that this is my heading and this is my first level heading. Now suppose I want to keep two types of bookmarks in my bookmarks. One is the main bookmarks and one is the secondary bookmarks. So I will use H2, that is the heading of the second level. So if you have used Microsoft Word, you will know what H1 and H2 are. But if you don't know, I will tell you that H1 is your main level heading. And the other level heading is from H2. Suppose I say main bookmarks and secondary bookmarks. Suppose I do something like this. And here I will press Alt, Shift and down arrow. I will do the work. Why don't I turn on the screencast mode? So what I did here is, Alt, Shift and down arrow are replicated. This is the shortcut for VS Code. I would like to tell you another shortcut for VS Code. If you press Alt in your keyboard and then wherever you click, it will become a cursor. Suppose I click outside, it will become a cursor. But by pressing Alt, if I click somewhere else, it will become a cursor. Suppose I want to do the bookmarks with the help of the code. So my bookmarks dash code with the help of the code. I can write something like this. How did I do this? I clicked here and then pressed Alt. And wherever I click, I will get multiple cursor. Then whatever I type, it will come in multiple cursor. Wherever there are cursor, whatever I type, it will be visible. Isn't it fun? Like this. So I will remove it like this. And you will see that it will be updated. So this is my main heading. This is my H2. Similarly, we have H6 heading with H1 H2. Suppose you gave a main heading. After the main heading, you gave a secondary heading. Then after that, you had to give some heading in it. And so on. You had to give a lot of subheadings. Then you can give H6 heading. H6 is more than enough. Html has given up to 6 headings. You will never need H7. If you talk in practical life. And if you read it, you can use H6 repeatedly. Because it is so small after H1. That H6 will become very small. So it will not be so small. Now what I will do here? I will stop Alt Shift down. I will replicate it. And I will click here. I will press Alt. I am telling you all these shortcuts so that your productivity increases. Now I have put two cursor here and here. I will press backspace and H3. Then I will click here. I will press Alt. I will click here. I will press H4. Okay. And I will click here. I will click here. I will click H5. Okay. After that I will click here. I will click here. I will click H6 here. So it is H6. Now what I will do? I will write here using H1 so that you know. I will write using here at least. I will press space. I will write using. I will write H. And here I have left my work. Click here. Two, three, four, five and six. And you see something like this. So you know that H1 is like this. H2 is like this. H3 is so small. H4 is so small. H5 is so small. H6 is so small. And what will happen if it is smaller than H6? This will be over in a while. So H6 is more than enough. So I will show you a practical demonstration of this. For example, this is my HTML tutorial. So here I have given the main heading. HTML introduction. After this I have given the word as HTML. Then I have given the features of HTML. I have given this from H1. I have given this from H2. After that I have given something in H2. So I have given something from H3. There is something in it too. Like here Y the term hypertext and markup language was. This is heading 2. What is the main heading page? HTML introduction. After this, this is sub-heading. I had to give an exercise in this too. So I used H3 in it too. Then I came back to H2. Because it was in it. So H1, H3, H4, H5, H6 are used to build the hierarchy. Okay. I hope you understood. Many people are commenting. You are starting very slowly. So we know. So I am making this course as a beginner course. When I tell you about HTML, then you will say yes. It is very easy. Then I will tell you a little bit of the CSS. You will say yes. This also comes. Then I will say JavaScript. Yes, okay. Give me a little bit. Then I will say bootstrap. Then you will say yes. This also comes. There is some problem. Then I will say react. Now people are saying what is happening? Then guess the node. Okay. Then after that I will take the things. To the MongoDB MySQL. Then after that, one type of level will go up. I had told you, we will raise the bar. Like anything. This is what I meant. So when we will react, when I will make projects there, when we will do dangerous things, then I will ask for their comments. Like tell me what is the level? Okay. So don't talk about the level. The level is going to rise. By doing very well. So these are our headings. 6 headings that I would like to keep like this. Now if we want to write a paragraph, then you can use the P tag. P enter will come. Now I will tell you a shortcut trick. If you want to bring dummy paragraph in the MET through VS code, then what will you do? You will write here. Suppose I wrote Lorem23. And here look, MET abbreviation came. This is the Lorem23. It will give me 23 words. Something like this. You can write words here with a view. Then you won't get horizontal stroll bar. So wrap this view. Now here you see Lorem. $. Here it is a dummy text. Why do we want dummy text sometimes? Because we are making templates. And we don't fill that template with anything. Suppose you are making a website, which looks like OEO rooms. Okay. Now here OEO become a member. OEO for business. I don't have to write all this here. I just wrote Lorem from here. Now I have to write something here. So I know Lorem here. I write 7 words. And I will enter Lorem 7. Then I will give it to OEO. They will do it as they want. Okay. Here you use it to fill the place holder. Okay. My plan is that we will make the clones of popular websites. So that you will know how things work. This is also a very popular website. You have used their services. So do tell me in the comment section. Now we will see other things. Like here is the paragraph. How to style it. And all these things are done through CSS. Now in the paragraph, look here. When I wrote Lorem 23, there are so many texts. Now I will enter P enter. If I write Lorem 10 here, then only 10 words will come. Okay. And if I write Lorem 100, if my page will be filled too much, then I can do that too. So this is the Lorem value trick. It is very good. You will enjoy it. And whenever we make a clone of popular websites, I will make a clone of Amazon.in. Okay. I make a clone of Amazon.in. So here, I have to write something. Okay. Now I can't see much text here. Suppose I have to write 3 words here. So I will write Lorem 3. I won't think about makeup products. I will write Lorem 4 here. Or I will write Lorem 3. I will write Lorem 2. And I will make a template and ready it. And then whatever it is, it will come in my database. And I can get it in my text. Many people asked me if this course will be ready. The answer is yes. This course will be ready. Absolutely. I will make you people so that you can actually do the industry level jobs through this course learning. Now let's talk about what are the attributes in HTML. These are the attributes in HTML. Like I used the HTML tag. Lang is equal to en, Lang is an attribute. We didn't use any attribute in the body. We didn't use any attribute in H1. We didn't use any attribute in P. But I can use a style attribute in P. Which is called inline CSS. If I red the background color here. Like this. The background color will get red. It is called inline CSS. Through style attribute. So if you add CSS to style is equal to, we had learned to add CSS here. But if you add style is equal to, you will get this background red here. Let me show you. You got this red red background. I will use this color. Or I will use this color. Thistle. This color is looking good. So I can also add style inline. But when you make an industry level website, we use inline styles very less. Because the sustainability decreases. Reusability decreases. So we want to shift small bundles on the browser. And our website is more optimized. That's why we avoid all these things. But inline CSS has a style tag. But here style is an attribute. It is a tag. It is an attribute style of p tag. Through which we can style this element. We will also have to talk about many other attributes. Attributes basically give an element enhanced functionality. Like this paragraph. We gave a style. Which was the background color. Thistle. To give this background color, we used style attribute. Similarly, to give properties, we used an attribute to give a tag. To give an element like this. We use attributes. Like if we talk about link. We talked about link colon CSS. Relic attribute in link. Hrfx attribute. So what can we do with this attribute? We can apply this CSS style sheet. Like background color. I think there is a body here. What we want in body is background color. And don't worry about it. Don't worry about it. How is it happening? Because in CSS, it will be told. But I am telling you that I am doing hot pink. Okay. Listen to another functionality of VS Code. This ninja technique will be useful. Over here. And here, you can choose the color you want. Around it. Like this. I will leave it. And do like this. So you see here. The background color of my body is like this. How did you like it? Ninja technique. Write in the comment. Ninja technique is very different. Okay. Now we are back in index.html. I can remove it if I want. If I comment it, then this style sheet will not be there. Which is very natural. The background color was coming from this style sheet. It was removed. This background color was coming from inline CSS. So it didn't remove it. Which is very natural. Okay. It is very normal. Here, I had settled this style is equal to background color. Because of which, it was looking like background color. Now we are going to make a bookmark. A bookmark manager is going to make it. BookmarkManager.html. And I am making it for a different file. Because here, I have told you different headings. I am going to make a useful bookmark manager. I will write here. BookmarkManager.html. Now you might ask, why are you making this bookmark manager in Chrome? This is made by our hands. This will be our child. We have made it. So you will get a different value for it. Because you made this yourself. Someone made a software. You bought it. You made a software yourself. So the software you made yourself, is different. Now you can see here, bookmark manager code was written. I will write H1 here. And I will write my bookmarks. Okay. I will write my bookmarks. Now I will write H2 here. I will write primary bookmarks. And after that, I will write secondary bookmarks. Okay. In fact, if I put all shift buttons here. And I will write secondary bookmarks. So what will happen? I can write secondary bookmarks here. Now what I will do? I will write in a paragraph. Google. Or I will write it like this. Okay. We will write it like this from the list. But in the coming videos, I will tell you. How to use the list. For now, you can understand. Google. Suppose I write it here. Open Google. And what will I do here? I will use anchor tag. So I will enter an A as in A. A is a mandatory attribute. Href. Href means, click it and go to which link. So I will write href is equal to. HTTPS colon double slash www.google.com. So it will go to this address. Whenever you click on open google. And I will cut open google. I will put it here. That is, the content of the stack will be like this. And here you can see. A href is equal to. This is open google. It is called anchor tag. Which helps us to make links. You must have seen many such links. Now you see here. As soon as I go to bookmarkmanager.html. You can see here. You can see all the bookmarks like this. You can see open google. Now I will click on it. Then google will open. You can see. Now one thing you noticed. When I did not click on it. Its color was blue. Now I visited it. Its color changed. So its color changes when you visit it. That is, it has been converted into a visited link. I am aware that I have visited it. Now I will tell you one more thing. If we want to open it in a new tab. Like I am clicking on it. It is opening in the same tab. If you want to open it in a new tab. You have two ways. Either you can click on the wheel of your mouse. I will tell you one other way. If you want to open a new tab. You can use an attribute. You can write here. Target is equal to underscore blank. And VS Code gives you suggestions. So I wrote it by hitting two enter. It is written in the notepad. It is written in any other cheap editor. So what would have happened to you. It is cheap according to the quality. Free VS Code is also there. But if you use a cheap editor according to the quality. So target is equal to underscore blank. You have to type it. It gets a little painful. But if you write it in any way. Now I will click on it. I am clicking. I am not clicking on the mouse wheel. I am clicking. I will click on the new tab. I will click on the mouse wheel. It will open in the new tab. So I can open it like this. Now I have written a very simple open google. If you want you can type your favorite website. You can type whatever website you like. You can type good website. Now I will write open facebook. And here you see www.facebook.com. And I will write here. Kora.com and CodeWithHari.com. And after that we will type. Which website should I type? YouTube.com. Let's see if it came here or not. You have seen one thing. It is coming in the same line. If you want it not to come in the same line. So what will you do? You will put it in your own paragraph. This is a very dirty way. I am calling it dirty way. I will tell you in the future. But you close it in a paragraph. If you want. And I will press shift. I will press the right arrow. I will press control X. Then I will press the end. All the cursors will go to the end. Because if you press the end on one cursor. Then they go to the end. And I will also press control. I have used this very shortcut. And many of you will be like this. What did you do? If you are a beginner. But I simply used the functionality of VS Code. The functionality of multiple cursors. I have used multiple cursors by pressing all. And after that I used it. This is not a good idea. We use the paragraphs. We never make a list. We make a list. But because we have not read the list. So we are using the paragraph. But this will do our job. This will look like this. And the ones we have not visited. Look they are blue. We visited Facebook. This color is also purple. We visited Kora. This color is also purple. So now this is your primary bookmarks. What are your secondary bookmarks? We will put two secondary bookmarks. The secondary bookmarks are those that you visit sometimes. Let's go to wikipedia.com. wikipedia.com is here. And believe me. Stackoverflow.com. We will write the spelling correctly. Stackoverflow. Let's capitalize Stackoverflow. And now look here. There are secondary bookmarks. Your Wikipedia and Stackoverflow are here. So this is your bookmark manager. And you can make this bookmark manager even better. We will learn the CSS styling. If you see this as the next one. Don't worry. Don't say that this is a very bad next one. Don't worry. Because we will do styling and designing in the coming time. We will talk about all that. Now for your bookmark. Bookmark manager is your title. And I will write it in H1. So both will be the same. Our title and H1. That is our title. This will also be the same. And my bookmarks will be written here. So you can make a bookmark manager like this. You can actually use it. Now if you save it like this. Like this is my bookmark manager. You can copy it and put it on your desktop. Whenever you want to open a website. You can just double click it. If you double click it and open it from VS code. Then what you will have to do. Right click it. Open with it. Choose another app. And then after that choose Google Chrome. Always do it. So I will choose Google Chrome. And I will always do it. So whenever I click twice. Google Chrome will open. So this was our bookmark manager. I hope you liked it. Now I have a request from you. Our 4 videos are completed today. If you like the course.
