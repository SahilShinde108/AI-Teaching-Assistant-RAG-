    "text": " Guys, we have seen almost everything in HTML. In today's video, we will talk about some miscellaneous things that we have concluded. Which will help you a lot in your web development journey. After that, we will start CSS with the upcoming videos. I am concluding HTML. I am very excited. Do like this video and write a sigma patch in the comment section below. Let's go in the computer screen. Let's roll the intro. As you can see, I have entered my computer screen. I will make a new folder without wasting time. The name of which I will name it Video 13. I will come in and click on Shift and open VS Code. And I will make a file. Index.html. Now I have given the file to index.html. Now I want to tell you something. There are many things in HTML that you have to explore. I will tell you some things and then I will conclude the HTML. If you want to download the screencast mode by opening the word wrap. If you want to write in HTML, this is 3 is greater than 4. If you want to write in HTML, I will show you the preview. So this is 3 is greater than 4. Now I will write this is the code for paragraph. And I will write something like this. I have written this. I want it to appear. But here you see that it will not appear. Why not? Because how will it know that I want to write the code for paragraph. Or I want to use the syntax of PTAG. So this is what HTML entities are for. Now I will tell you what HTML entities are. If you write here ampersandltsemi column. LT for less than. So you can write this as LTsemi column. Now if you write here ampersandltsemi column. And you will replace it with ampersandltsemi column. And the greater than is simple. You replace it with ampersandltsemi column. I will show you by doing this. If you replace it with ampersandltsemi column. So what will happen? As it is written here, it will appear here. As you can see here. I will zoom it here. So what happens that HTML entities are used. To write those things. Which is collided with the syntax of HTML. What will be collided? If we write paragraph tag here. How will we know HTML is the code of paragraph tag. Or you actually want to write this as it is. There is a pre tag for this. If you put anything in pre tag. And you write here. Then P this is a paragraph. If you write it like this. Then here it will appear as it is. As you can see. It will appear as it is. And along with that. If you write new lines here. This is after few new lines. And some more. If you write it like this. As it is. It will keep all the spaces intact. It keeps all the new lines intact. But here it will not show up as tag. We will have to use the entities for tags. So this happens in pre tag HTML. So we have seen the entities. We have seen pre tag. If you want to put the symbol of copyright. Then you can write ampersandltsemi column. And as you write ampersandltsemi column. Then you will get to see the symbol of copyright. As you can see. You can do this with the help of HTML entities. So try out all these examples. Along with non-breaking spaces. You will see special symbols like copyright. Ampersandltnbsp is used for space. And it is very important. So if I write copyright. I write copyright. I want to see many spaces here. And I write code with her. So if I write code with her. Then this space will be considered as fake space. Because the extra spaces in HTML are ignored. So here you will see the code is written right after the copyright. But ideally we don't want this. What we want is. We want these spaces that I have put. So you don't put spaces. You put ampersandltnbsp. You will put ampersandltnbsp as many times as you want. You see these spaces are coming. So you have to put literally space in your HTML code. Ampersandltnbsp is something you should go after. So here you have to put these breaking spaces. And the reserved characters in the HTML. Like less than, greater than. You can do all this with HTML entities. After this, quotation tag. Quotation tag helps you to write quotation like this. I will also tell you the example of quotation tag. So quotation tag works like this. And as soon as you write quotation text here. So you will know the search engine. That you are actually writing quotation. And you can style it with CSS. Then you can put the URL of anything you want to site. Similarly you can use Q tag. Site is equal to URL. So you can site it with any research article. Or there are other reasons. If you want to site wikipedia. Then this tag is used. And you can style it with CSS. So these are our quotation tags. And HTML entities. Then there are some HTML tags that have been obsolete. Like font tag has been obsolete. Because we handle font with CSS. We don't use font tag. There were many attributes in font like color, size. And you can use font tag like this. But it's not recommended to use font tag. Then center tag. It might help to center things. But I will also recommend you that we will center with CSS. Flexbox Grid, which is a modern CSS. So these are all the tags. You should know about them. But you should also know that you don't have to use them. Okay. I hope that helps. Then code tag. The most important tag for coders. Like you are watching this website. Codewithherry.com. You are watching the code tag I have used here. And if you are very interested in this. Then I will tell you that I am using a library named prismcss. Many people ask me. And how do I do all this? I will tell you this. Prism.js. Prism.js. Prism.js. What happens is that your code is highlighting. You can put code in your blog. So I am using this library. I will tell you how to do all this. I am using React as well. So all those things are coming. Don't worry. But if you want to write code. You have to use code tag. If you write it in the source code. Then you will see that any code is written in the code tag. I have put the code tag. If you look below. So any kind of code you will get on my site. It will be in the code tag. You can copy it. You can paste it. You can write the multi-line code. In the code tag. Why do you want to put pre-line? So that the new lines are intact. For example, I want to write a code here. And here I want to write a Python code. Okay. Or I want to write HTML code. I will do control n. And here I will do HTML. And I will enter by marking the exclamation mark. And here I will copy and paste. And I will write in H1. That this is. I will write in H1. This is HTML boilerplate code. Okay. So if I preview this. So here this is HTML boilerplate code. Actually it was rendered. If I want to write code as it is. So what I will have to do? That this less than sign. I will have to replace it. Right click change all occurrences. And what will I do here? m%LT semicolon. I told you LT semicolon. And along with it, the greater than symbol. Right click change all occurrences. m% m%GT semicolon. Now I will paste this code. I can't do as it is. Okay. So this is also very important. Now you will see. So here see the code as it is. So if you want to copy anything. You can do it. Note one thing. Because of pre-tag, these spaces are also coming. If you want to remove these spaces. Then you select them. Shift or tap. So what is shift tab? An indent decreases. Okay. So you can do this. And after that. Here I will press backspace. And here too I will put extra space. And you see your code as you want. It has come. Okay. And you can do it with CSS style. We will use prism CSS. I will tell you how. You have to use this type of libraries. There will be a lot of things in the coming videos. I wanted to tell you about some of the HTML tags. You should know about those. Okay. Then after this character sets. Character sets. Which characters are you using in your page? Then canvas. What is canvas? Basically, the use of canvas is mainly done through JavaScript. But you can understand something like. There is an element in HTML. Which is what we make graphical shapes. Okay. I hope you all have understood the whole content of HTML in this video. From the coming videos. Now we will do CSS. HTML is concluded. I hope you are enjoying it. The whole source code is being uploaded here on GitHub. So do access it. Along with that. This playlist is not being accessed. So click here and bookmark it. Or click and save it. That's all for now. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time."
