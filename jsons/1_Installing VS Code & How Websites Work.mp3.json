Like it with high energy because in this video, I am going to take you from zero and make you a profitable web developer. This course will be modern because web development has changed over time. A lot of new things have come. A lot of things have come in JavaScript which makes the work very easy. A lot of technologies have come which will make your work very easy. This course will be for those who don't know anything. You know that it is zero for you if you know about web development. We will start from zero but we will raise the bar like anything. What we will learn in this course, I will tell you in a little while. Web development is a very profitable thing. I have personally earned a lot of money through web development. And I believe that you can also be very successful by learning web development. During the course, you will get notes, cheat sheets, references, all these things. This course is going to be a little different because in this course, I will tell you the technologies that you should learn as much as possible according to your experience. And I will make this course a complete course with all the web development technologies. There will be course content, complete web development, front end, back end, database. I will teach you as much as you want to learn. I will tell you the course content in a little while. But you guys keep faith that you will become a full stack developer. A lot of projects will be done in the future during the course. And in the end of the course, we will make some good projects so that you can be very strong in web development. According to me, project based learning is the best way to learn. So I will make you a lot of projects and if you agree, then write it in the comment section below. Because when you comment, then my face gets a smile. So do comment. I want to make you believe that after finishing this course, you can make any kind of website from the beginning to the end. And during this course, I will make you a lot of websites so that your confidence will go up a lot. So let's start with the first video of our Sigma web development course. Let's roll the intro. And I guess I have come to my computer screen. And now as I am doing, you guys follow me. I have downloaded Google Chrome browser here. You also download Google Chrome browser. I am not saying this, it won't work. But you guys have to do exactly what I am doing here. So here we will follow exactly as I am doing. And along with that, you will be able to follow exactly as the videos will come. I will go to Google and I will write down the download VS Code. Now what is VS Code? VS Code is a source code editor. If you are in Windows, then I will click on Windows. If you are in Mac, Linux or any other operating system, then you can download it for that strange operating system. And the process is exactly the same. You can see that my downloads folder is here. VS Code has come here. And here as you can see, the setup is downloaded. I will refresh here. And here, look at it, I can double click VS Code setup here and install. So simply, we have to install VS Code. It is as easy to install the game here. You quickly agree here. This lies in the slide. It cuts through, it cuts through, it cuts through, it cuts through, it cuts through. It damages. And after this I will accept the agreement and I will accept it. You also read like me. I am the fastest reader in the world. Oh my God! Next, next check both the icons. If you want desktop shortcuts, you can create a desktop icon. Next, install. If your PC is fast like mine, then it will be fast. But if your PC is slow, then it's not a problem. Install it slow. I recommend you to subscribe to the channel. I want you to follow along with the videos. If you want to follow the course completely, then you should subscribe. With that said, our VS code is downloaded. I have opened my VS code. Don't be afraid of this. I am repeating this again. If you know something, then you can start it. We are starting it with beginner friendly. But we will raise the bar like anything in the upcoming videos. So stay tuned. I will also request you to tell me in the comment section what is your level. Beginner, advanced, or intermediate user. In the comment section, tell me where does web development come from. Beginner, advanced, intermediate. Please comment below. Now, what is the VS code? If you don't know what is VS code, then let me tell you that it is a code editor. Which helps you to edit code. Now you can edit the code in the notepad. So yes, do it in the notepad. It will be done in it. Yes, I am not doing it in the sarcastic way. It will be done in it. Here we set it up and show what is in it. Which makes it a little different from the notepad. Now, look at this. Let's set it up quickly. I will not do color themes here. In fact, I will do it. I will keep it dark modern. I will keep theme and I have done it. Next section. After this, next section. You can close the welcome if you want. But first, I am telling you some tips. That's it. The VS code here has started. This is the VS code screen. You can see here you can make a new file. You can make a new folder. But I will recommend you to close it. Yes, you can close it. Why did you close it? I am going to make a new folder here. And I am going to keep it in its name. You guessed it right. Sigma web development course. We will do everything in this course. We will do everything. I mean, understand that we will do everything related to course. We will not do much. Now, here you will shift and right click on the app in Windows. So, you can see here that there is an option called open with code. This option called open with code helps you open this particular folder in VS code. You will select it here. Now, here you will say yes, I trust this file. Click on this here and say yes, I trust the authors. And this folder is now open. I mean, if I click on plus, there is a new file to be made. Suppose I wrote here index.html. Write it now. If you don't know what I am writing. Write it. Enter it. And then what I will do is, I will write here, hey, I am your first HTML file. Suppose I wrote this. Here you can see the ring. This is the white color ring. The ring means that you haven't saved this file. Save it by doing it. If you hit control, it will be saved. I will recommend you to enable auto save option by going to the file. So, as soon as you type, you will not see this ring. Your file will instantly be saved as soon as you type. And I recommend this too. We will not use control less. Otherwise, if you want to save it with control less, you can disable this option. I would like you to do one more thing. Click on gear here and click on settings. And search here mouse. Mouse. Now, you can see editor mouse wheel zoom. Check it. I will tell you what will happen if you check it. Just close it by checking it in settings. You don't have to be scared at all. What is VS code? How is VS code? What is this? Why is this? What is this news? But you don't have to see all this. Now, by pressing control, you will simply scroll like this. So, what happens is that your font size changes. Now, I will show you a magic. Magic is very simple. The logic is that in the downloads, in the folder called sigma web development course, this file is created. Index.html. Which is very natural. Because I have opened this folder in VS code. So, because I have opened this folder in VS code, this file is also created here. I will make another file here. Suppose I make a file from this.txt. I will write this is this. So, what will happen? This file will also be created here. You can see. So, this folder and these VS codes are both in sync. Now, if I open this file from here from the notepad. And I will show you that this file will be opened in notepad. So, I can do that too. That is also my wish. But I will not use notepad. Because there are some things in VS code that don't give me notepad. And I want to get those features. I don't want to overrun you. But I will show you that what is in VS code that you don't get in notepad. Suppose I write here.html. If I enter, it automatically gives me the opening closing tag. If I enter exclamation mark here. It gives me a boilerplate template. I will click on it. So, see the basic code of html is here. We will discuss about this later. You don't get overwhelmed at all. But as I want to tell you that what is the benefit of VS code. Why we didn't use notepad or VS code. And this feel is coming. The great feel is coming to us. The feel of developer, hacker. That feel is also important. Only then there will be a confidence to do coding. For Mac and Linux users, I want to comment on something similar. For you. I am using windows. I don't have windows laptop. I can't use three laptops. Linux, Mac and Windows 3. I can't use them all together. So, exactly the same things will be there for you. In fact, I should say that similar things will be there. Exactly the same things will be there. You will be able to follow along very easily. So, don't take tension at all. I will tell you about some extensions. In a little while. And you will enjoy using those extensions. And you will also say that it was fun. What did you recommend. But I will tell you in a little while. And this is criminally underrated. I am telling you that you will enjoy. I want to tell you that you will right click on command palette. So, there are many options of VS code. You don't need to know all these options. Like we will move forward in the course. The features that will come in use. I will tell you all these. And you can use them. But what I will do here is. I will toggle the screencast mode. You don't have to do this. But I will do it. So, you will know. I clicked. So, you see, I will type anything. If I press caps lock. Then, it will click caps lock. So, you will know when I pressed any button. Now, this thing is not relevant for you. But I just want to tell you that the screencast mode. The screencast mode. We can change its settings from here. Now, here you see the vertical offset of screencast mode. What does vertical offset mean? If I set the vertical offset to zero. Then, it will come up. If I set the vertical offset to 70. Then, it will come down. I will set it to 60. If I set it to 60. If I set it to 80. Then, it will come up. It means. From bottom, it will come up. So, I set it to zero. In fact, I set it to one. Now, I will type anything. I will do this. It will come up. It will come up. Which is ideal. So, I will close this.txt file. I will close the settings tab. For the tabs. For Chrome, there are tabs. You have exactly the same tabs. So, I hope you have understood what it is. What we have written about it. I will tell you step by step. Exactly what is it. You can also close the welcome page of VS Code. If you are zooming in VS Code. I will do it because I am recording the video. Add control plus. Add numpad plus. Look below. I have shown you. I am zooming in. I am zooming in because I am recording the videos. Ideally, I want you to see the screen from the past. But when I am doing my coding. I don't zoom in that much. You have to keep this in mind. So, these are related to VS Code. I want to tell you how websites work. A website basically works through three types of people. Imagine three people. One is Client. One is Server. Who is Client? Who is the second? Server. Who is the third? Browser. Who is also called Babu. Browser. So, Browser. Client. Server. What is this Client? What is this Server? What is this Browser? Client who I am. You. We all. Who is the browser? This is Chrome. Hello Chrome. I am Client. I will tell Client. When I write codewithherry.com. I write codewithherry.com. So, basically, what I say? I say to this browser. That by doing this, give me codewithherry.com website. Or if I write here youtube.com. I say give me youtube.com website. I say to the browser. Give me youtube.com. I want to watch YouTube. Browser says that you want YouTube. Take it. Okay. So, I will enter youtube.com. So, from the server. YouTube.com has brought it. Do you understand? From the server. He brought youtube.com and passed it. And showed me this screen. This is the reason why I am so fast. Because my internet.com is very fast. Nowadays, people are so fast. But still, according to my locality, it is very fast. So, with this fast internet speed, all these things are very fast. So, Client server sends a request through the browser. The browser is my assistant. I will do the same with the browser. He will help me to get this web page from the server. So, who is managing the server? The server is managing the youtube.com server. And there is a code in the server. Which sends me this kind of code. When I write youtube.com, this code comes. How to convert this code into this? This is the work of the browser. So, what I have to show is the work of the browser. So, Client browser says something like Hey, what? Give me youtube.com. The browser says what? You want youtube.com. Wait. I will ask youtube.com. The browser sends a request to the server. The server says give me youtube.com. The server will give it to me. It will not say here. It will say error. It will say that the server error is done. Whatever the response is, ideally, which should be 200, the response code is 200. With that response, the browser that is our, that comes back to the client. And shows this kind of page. I hope you have cleared this. Client browser server. The browser has the browser. The server has the browser. The browser returns to the client. So, this is how it works. This is a little more important. I will tell you once more. When you write Google.com. Any website, Google.com. So, Client browser says Give me google.com. The browser says, Hey Guru Dev, You want google.com. Wait. I will give you the server. So, the server goes to the browser. And the Google.com gets it. And gives it to you. You have Google.com. It comes. Now, along with Google.com, The server has all the images, all the videos, all the things that are sent. These icons, all these things are sent. The URL of these icons is also written in this code. And that too, the browser works. That we display it correctly. So, the server that is there, sends the browser a whole bundle. Sends this kind of bundle. And passing this bundle, showing it like this, is the work of the browser. Now, the user who will do the further interaction, will get an additional browser request along with this page. If I write and inspect it, and then go to the network. And here I will write, believe me, Harry brother. I have written Harry brother. So, when so many requests are sent, for images, and so many requests are sent, So, as you interact, as well as, you will have to send an additional request to the browser. So, by combining the code, you can understand it like a restaurant. You have given an order, that is, on the request page, you have given an order, your order was taken by a waiter. The waiter went to the kitchen, he sent your order to the kitchen. You can understand the kitchen as a server. And finally, when the kitchen has given the order back, So, what did this waiter do, who is working as a browser, that waiter saw it, and he gave you the order back. It is possible that he could not get it in the order kitchen, for some reason. It is very rare that you guys order something and you didn't get it. But it happens sometimes. Similarly, sometimes it happens here too. You get the error, 4 not 4 error, or 500 error, the server is not working, this kind of error. So, whenever you get this kind of error, you are told. But ideally, 200, that is, the response is okay. And you get this kind of webpage. So, you can understand it like a restaurant. So, whenever you write google.com.slashmail, if google.com.slashmail is available, you will get it. And if you write codewithary.com.slashcontact, codewithary.com.slashcontact, if it is available, you will get it. If it is not available, you will get it. Or if it is 500 error, you will get a 500 error page. You will get whatever server you send. So, this cycle is going on. Client sent me a request, the browser sent me a server, the server processed me a request. After that, the server sent the data back to the browser. And whatever data was sent, the browser showed it to the client. Then, the client did something. The browser sent the same request to the server. Then, the server sent something. Whatever data the server sent, the client returned it to the browser. And so on. So, now you can understand it. But what is backend? What does backend mean? Backend is how the server is processing the request. Now, if you believe that you have a blog. There is a lot of data in the blog. So, what will you do? You will store every web page of the blog separately. Or you will generate that content dynamically. I will take an example of Google. If I search here, you can see that the Google header, these are the links. This format does not change at all. If I write here, Shubham. I have written Shubham here. So, as soon as I write Shubham, you can see that when I wrote Harry by, I am showing a very similar content of it. So, what does Google do? The backend of the Google server. The backend processes the data in this way. The backend processes the data in this way. That it can send it for this kind of HTML corresponding query. That is, when I write Shubham, I write this. When I write Harry, I write this. So, the way to generate this thing, through which system is happening, is the same backend. Now, this backend can be Jango. This backend can be Flask. This backend can be Node. This backend can be PHP. This backend can be Ruby on Rails. And the data base in the backend is used. The backend code is not visible to the client. This is the front end code that sends the server. And how did the server make this code? We don't know that. Because this is running on the server. If you are confused, don't be confused at all. You will understand all these things. We will see the backend in the future. Now, we understand how the front end works. The front end is primarily made with three languages. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. These are the three languages that you need. If you are making a website, then every website needs HTML, CSS, JavaScript in most of the cases. If you use only HTML, then the basic skeleton of the website is made. After that, when you use CSS, you can style it. By doing this, you can see the button. So, you can see the CSS only. Along with that, you can see this button red. You can see this button as a curve. This is all thanks to CSS. You can see the edges here. This is all thanks to CSS. So, the CSS works is to style a page. What color, what color, what will be the color, all these things are done through CSS. There is a beauty of CSS of HTML page. HTML is a solid body of any page. This is a standard that is agreed. If anyone makes a website, then they will make it on HTML. So that the browser can understand how to parse it. The browser works is to parse HTML. And HTML is a skeleton. This is a standard. Anyone who makes a website in this world will make it on HTML. It will use a skeleton HTML. This is a standard. This is a standard so that everyone makes the same type of pages. And if someone is making a browser, then they have to parse the same language. If you have learnt 80% HTML as a beginner, then you are good to go for web development. Now, there are some things directly from HTML. For example, if I write a lot of HTML codes, I am writing some HTML codes like this. I am writing it. I have used the MET abbreviation. Don't worry at all. I will write this as HTML. And I can open this HTML file directly. And as soon as I open this HTML file directly, you will see that it will open like this. I can open it directly. I will double click it. And it opened. This is written as HTML. But this is not styled. This HTML file is very basic. You can run videos directly from HTML. I have an HTML file that I will show you. You can run videos from it. I will change this HTML file. So that we can show videos in it. So there is a video tag in HTML. If we enter the video, then whatever video you put in SRC, it will play. For example, if I put video1.mp4 here. You see, VS Code has automatically shown me video1.mp4. This is the benefit of using VS Code. So you see here that I will reload it. So here this video is automatically shown. I can play it. To play it, I have to write controls here. And I will refresh it now. So I will have the controls to play it. I can play it. This is a magic. For selling, a person needs it very much. How much money does he need? He is asking for 130 crores. Final, absolutely. Now if I put video2.mp4 here. I had put video1 here. I have two more videos. I have some other videos here. I will put it here. And after that, I will refer to them. If I put video2.mp4 in their place, then video2 will be seen. I will reload and show you. What you have done, I have put Ben Stokes. And now, by doing this, I have shown people. What to do? These Ben Stokes look alike. Now if I do video3 here. Suppose I do video3 here. So my third video will be there. So I will reload it. And you see, I can play it. Yes, sir. Give me something to eat. This is our third video. I have put video3.mp4 here. So I will close it. And similarly, we can play video4. And I have video4. I have a DJ video. In which DJ is playing. So you see this. So you can make such things. Just by using FHDMIL. Not that you don't need to do anything else. You can play videos with FHDMIL. You can display images. All this can be done with FHDMIL. Now if you want to style it. Suppose I want a border to come here. Or a red background. So what I have to do for that. I have to use CSS for that. CSS adds beauty to any website. Then comes JavaScript. Which adds interaction to a website. For example, what will happen when I click on search. What will happen when I click on code with. Like code with hr is written. And here auto complete. Why did this come? Because there was a request on the server. And for this query. The results of auto complete came here. So all these things are from JavaScript. This is called Client Site Scripting. That is, if we want to do scripting in client. If we want to do coding. Only on client site. So we can do that. With the help of JavaScript. So our website becomes beauty with brain. I am talking about website beauty with brain. CSS adds beauty. And brain came from JavaScript. Now JavaScript helps you to make the page dynamic. For example, if you want to change the content. Then all this is done with JavaScript. There are a lot of mosquitoes here. So I will kill these mosquitoes. Oh, the mosquitoes are not doing anything here. My racket is working. Oh my God. Like the video. Because I eat current chips for you. So when I was in college. I was shocked that I have to learn HTML, CSS, JavaScript. First learn HTML, 100% learn Client. Then learn CSS. Until I remember all the properties. Then learn JavaScript. But this expression is absolutely wrong. Why is it wrong? Because HTML you only 80%. And CSS you only 40% 60%. And JavaScript you only 70% 70%. You can start web development. You can make projects. And make and make and make and make. You can move ahead from there. Okay, in the future in this course. I will tell you about the impact of chat GPT and web development. So we will also talk about this. You are tuned. So never run behind perfection. Take HTML and CSS. Don't think that I will do one year HTML. I will do CSS in the next year. Then I will do JavaScript in the next 30 years. Then I will make projects in the next 14 years. Never think that. Do HTML 80%. CSS 40% 60%. And JavaScript is 50% 70%. You can make a great website by learning 80%. And as you will continue to make websites. Your experience will teach you more HTML. More CSS. More JavaScript. And you will not know that you have perfected HTML. CSS JavaScript. While you are making money. And working as a professional web developer. So you will be earning along with learning. And you will be moving ahead with your skills. So never think that I will remember all the HTML tags. Then I will make a website. I will remember all the CSS properties. I will make all the JavaScripts. I will teach you this much. I will teach you just that much. So you will learn what matters. And I don't want you to learn for years. That's why I designed this course. So that you can learn only that which matters. And the rest you will learn from practice. And in many practices I will make you do it in this course. Here we have 2-4 mosquitoes to learn the Sigma Web Development course. Which is good. Our audience is increasing. In this course we will learn the first HTML. Then we will learn CSS. Then JavaScript. And I will tell you such tricks in this course. Which you will not have heard anywhere. And I have learned different points and points from my career. I will tell you about it in this course. I have learnt some amazing tricks in my career. And I want you to learn all the tricks from the beginning. Now if you have any doubts in this course. In the upcoming videos. Then you can use the hashtag doubt. And use this hashtag to ask your doubts. I am going to try to answer all the doubts. I will try. I will try my best to solve your doubts. So if you have any questions. So use the hashtag doubt. And please don't use the hashtag doubt in the comments. Write them without the hashtag doubt. So that I can prioritize the comments of the hashtag doubt. I will try to answer all the doubts as much as I can. And you will learn everything in this course. So like this course if you haven't done it yet. That will bring a smile on my face. So do it. Now what is this react. What is the next JS. What is the angular. So look at all these front end frameworks. They help you to use JavaScript. That is HTML CSS is a website. They help you to make this process faster. How? We will learn this course in the future. Yes. We will learn in this course. We will learn in this course. I had told you that I will make this course completely different. I will make you like this. That I will take you from zero to hero in web development. Take your seat belt. Because you have taken the ticket of Sigma Web Development Express. I want to give you a good analogy. To teach HTML CSS and JavaScript. HTML is just like car skeleton. If you paint CSS in it. And internal engine car is in it. So that is JavaScript. Look at an example of a person. The skeleton is HTML. After that skin is in it. So CSS. And brain is in it. The nervous system is JavaScript. Now I will take you to phobes.com. If you go to phobes.com. There is a website here. And phobes.com is a website. Which uses HTML CSS and JavaScript. Like any other website. If I click on right click. Click on inspect. Then look here. The inspect element is opened. Now look here. They have used script in the head. And here they have used link to add CSS. So what I will do here. I will remove their CSS. So what I will do to remove CSS. I will clear all their style tags. By using delete key. So as soon as I remove all the style tags. And as soon as I remove all the link tags. So as soon as I have deleted all their style sheets. Look at the condition of this page. This page is showing something like this. They have only raw HTML in it. What size of images should be. What kind of images should be. They have forgotten all this. And only raw HTML is written here. Which is not styled at all. So the condition of phobes.com is something like this. Without CSS. Without CSS. They are showing only raw buttons. Showing raw text. Showing raw links. And similarly. I can remove the script accent. And see without JavaScript. How it will look like. Now if I delete the HTML tag of this page. Like this. I have deleted all the head. I have deleted all this. So this is a blank page. That is without HTML. This is not even the condition. So this is the role of HTML, CSS and JavaScript. In making a web page. I would like to tell you about this course. It was initially made to be paid. But I changed my mood. And converted it to free course. And I thought I will put it on YouTube. So I want you all to be serious. Many people have reached out to me. To launch paid course. They are big companies. But I could hear a voice from my heart. I should keep this course free. Because when I learnt web development. I can understand. When you don't have a course to learn well. And you don't have the affordability to buy a paid course. I can understand. And I decided that this is a course. Development course. It should be launched absolutely free. This course is free. But it is free. As you all will earn crores in the coming time. You all will give me tea, coffee, parties. This is our agreement in this video. So when you start earning crores. And you start earning lakhs. After this course. Send me a green leaf. Or red leaf. But you have to do this. When you start earning well. Only after you start earning good. So while keeping you aside. In the next video. I will tell you how you can earn money. To complete this course. But I will add light on this. Because this is also important. Come on. How will you earn money. That is also important. Personally. I do freelancing like this. How do clients come. I will tell you everything. I want to tell you some action items. The first action item. You all should access this course. The playlist. I will give you in the description. Everyone should bookmark that playlist. Press the star button here. Open that playlist. And then press the star button. And then bookmark. And there is a save button. Save in a playlist. Many of you have said. The course is paid. We will buy it. Thank you so much for all the support. And whoever you show me love. You show me trust. I have the courage. But this course is going to be free. Technical issues. No one should come. In all these videos. I am putting this in resolution from 1080p. So you should give it very clearly. But those people say. That it is in SD. It is in video 240p. It is in 144p. You all watch Bali's Wadhu. You finish Jio's internet. From morning till evening. Watch Bali's Wadhu. And then you tell me. These are your videos. These are not. Some Nagar Pali's Kublao. So I hope you have understood the request. What is the response. How do these websites work. We got a basic idea. How is client-server interaction. In the upcoming videos. We will see how the website is made. We are going to make our first website in the next video. So you should be excited. Because our first website is going to be in the next video. And maybe some of you are the first website. So access the playlist. Thank you so much guys for watching this video. And I will see you next time."}
