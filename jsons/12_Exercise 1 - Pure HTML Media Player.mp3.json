I will also give a shout out to all of you. So write in the comment section if you accept this challenge, I will give you a question and you will have to solve it. And it will be a basis for all the things we have studied in the Sigma Web Development course on those concepts. So I am very excited to give you a question. I hope you are equally excited. Let's roll the intro. Music So guys, as you can see in the computer screen, if you haven't accessed all the playlists yet, then click here and click on this playlist. Click here and save it. And if you haven't accessed the code, then that too is all updated on the Github. I will keep updating it as the videos will keep on increasing. Now for the question I want to give you, I will make a folder first. I will definitely name it as Folder. I will shift the video to 12 and open it with code. And everyone should accept this challenge. If you accept it, I will feel good. What you do here is that I will make an index.html here. And I will give you a question. So the question is, you are given 12 video files. Okay, 12 files, 6 audio and 6 video. And 6 video. Design a website using HTML only. And which shows these 12 files. Okay, I will do a toggle word wrap here. So that you can see the word wrap. So what you have to do is that you are given 12 files. And what are the names of those files? 1.mp3, 2.mp3. So let me tell you what are the names of those files? 1.mp3, 2.mp3, all the way till 6.mp3. So these are your MP3 files. Then you have 1.mp4, 2.mp4, all the way till 6.mp4. Okay, these are your files. So these are the files that you have to show by previewing. So I hope this will be done. It is a very simple question. And you all should quickly comment and write the challenge accepted. Because if you accept this challenge, then you can write the challenge accepted in the first instance. And whoever will give me the code here, I will give a shout out. The person who will write the challenge accepted will get a shout out for sure. And in the comment section, you all should definitely tell me. So I hope you will complete this. And it is a very simple question. I know that many people will also say that this is very simple. One more thing I will hope from you all is that you all should try to solve this question by using it more often. So this was the question of today. I hope you all enjoyed it. I will select it and forward slash it. And what happens if you do the control forward slash? That you can comment or uncomment. So if you will do the control forward slash, then look at this. And if you will do the control forward slash again, then this comment is done. So you have to complete this website. It is a very simple problem. It is a straight forward problem. Everyone should definitely solve it. So that's all for today's video. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time."}
