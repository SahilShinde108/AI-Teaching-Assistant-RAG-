classes. The concept of ID and classes is one of the concepts that are confused. In fact, when I was learning HTML in my early days, I was confused in the ID and classes. ID means unique identifier. If you give an ID to an element, you will not give it to another element. But the meaning of the class is that if you want to give multiple elements to a property, you will give it multiple classes. For example, you can give a class called red, a div, and a form. Similarly, you can give an article tag or header tag for the class called bg red. Do like this video because we will go into the computer screen and we will see these things very closely. Let's roll the intro. I am back and if you have not accessed the Sigma Web Development course, then access the playlist. Click here and save the bookmark. The source code is also being uploaded on GitHub. I will come here in the folder and make a folder of video number 9. I will make a folder of video number 9 and after making a folder of video number 9, I will click shift and open it. You can see that this code is open in BS code. I will write index.html here and enter the exclamation mark. Now I will tell you what are the ID and classes. You will have a basic card or not? If you do not have any ID, then you will have no ID. Do not write in the comment that I do not have ID. If you go to any place, then you have to show ID. In some of the cases, to prove your identity. I am like this. Now if you want to understand ID and classes in the restaurant, then the ID is your identity. So listen to the story here. This is John and this is Harry. They are very good friends. They are very good friends. They do not share their lunch and the rest are very good friends. They do not share their lunch and the rest are friends. Now you can see that John and Harry have their own basic card ID. So this is my basic number and John's basic number looks like this. So this is John's basic number and this is my basic number. Both of us can never have the same basic number. Or if you think that our friend is my friend, Tania and John's friend is my friend, then start. So their basic number will also be different. This is Tania's basic number. This is Tania's basic number. Now each person has different basic number. So John and Harry were friends and John became a friend. This is Tania's basic number. None of these four numbers are the same. If I tell you one of these numbers, I will say 35, 34, 35, you will understand that it is Harry's. And if I say 46, 46, you will understand that it is Tania's. And if I say 34, 46, 48, 48, 48, then you will understand that it is Tania's. So this is a unique number that Tania, Harry, Shruti and John have. So what is this? This is their basic number, that is their ID. This is their basic number and no one else will get it. Along with that, John and Harry were childhood friends and they were in the same class. And the name of that class was class 10. Both of them are in the 10th class. So listen to me. And Shruti is in the 9th class. And Tania is in the 9th class. So both are in the 9th class. Tania is in the 9th class and Shruti is in the 9th class. So what is the class of Shruti? It can be 9th class. Shruti will have to study alone in this class. Or Harry will have to study alone in the 10th class and children also. So the class means that in one class, Harry and John are. So can a person have a multiple? A person can have a multiple in the class. For example, Harry is in the 10th class. And he goes to a tuition where this class is in the 10th class. Even in Malo's tuition, there are classes. So there can be more than one class. One is class 10. And one is class 10A. And along with that, Malo wears a red T-shirt. So his class is red too. So the class doesn't mean that he is going to study. The class means that he is classified in this class. So understand this. Now come here. Leave John and Harry Shruti. Okay, I will delete it. I will zoom out and delete it. It doesn't mean anything here. Now come to index.htm and understand this. Malo, I have made a div here. And I have given it a class red. And I have made a span. And I have given it a class red. Okay, whatever classes I have given. I can give different elements or the same class. But if I want to add an ID in any element. Malo, I have added an ID in the first div. I can add anything in the ID. So this is the idea. I can't give any other element. Because this is the basis of this element. If the other div is also there, then I can't add it. Even then I will have to add something else. Okay, I have added the second div. Okay, and here I write the second and here I write the first. So this idea and the concept of classes. I personally don't know. I understood it very late. When I was learning Web of Lullipants in my early days. I didn't tell anyone that the idea unilindifies the element. And the class is. It can be applied in multiple classes in one element. And it can be applied in multiple elements in one class. Understand, like if I have given it a red class. I can give it a BGLO class. Okay, BGLO. I can give it a class. And if we give a class in multiple elements. Then we apply space. Like if I want to add multiple classes in this element. Then what will I do? First I will write red here. Then I will write BGLO in space. So this way I can give multiple classes in the same element. Can I give the same element multiple ID? Have you ever heard of someone's two thousand cards? I don't know if there is anyone who makes it. But it doesn't have an identity card. The identity card is one person's number. And the identity card can't be the same as a different person. Okay? A person can't have multiple cards. A different person can't have the same card. But the class. If I say which color t-shirt you wear. Or you can wear a red color t-shirt. It's okay. If you go on the road, you will get it. And if you like mangoes or bananas. Or if you like grapes, you will get multiple people. So consider that in the banana class. Or in the grapes class. In the mango class. So we can classify in a class. And we can give different elements to one class. So I hope you understood this. Now I will write CSS here. And don't say that you are not studying CSS. What am I writing in CSS? You can understand it like this. I am writing some alien language. Okay? In style.css. But I am trying to make a point. I will click here. And here its preview is looking like this. First or second. I will show you one thing. First, in CSS, we target dot. Dot red means red class. And hash first div means. Hash means ID. Dot means class. Okay? If I say that the first div. Color the background of it red. Okay? So if you color the background of first div. It will be red. Okay? These are the selectors in CSS. And now I don't want to confuse you. And I can comment like this in CSS. Okay? But we will read all these things. Now what I will do after dot red? I will write background color red. And also what I will do in dot bg yellow? Dot bg yellow is my dot. I have to put dot. Dot means class. It means class bg yellow. And I will yellow the background color. Sorry, I will color it. I will not color the background color red. Dot red means color is red. Look, its color is red. And the background color is yellow. So in this way you can use ID and classes in CSS. I hope you have understood something. Now one thing that you have to note here is that The ID and classes are attributes of the element. This is ID attribute and this is class attribute. So what are the ID classes? Are they elements or not? They are attributes of elements. Now one more use of ID. I will tell you what is the use of ID. If I take you to Wikipedia and write the coding. So this page of Wikipedia. I will go to some other page on some big page. So when you go to any page on Wikipedia, What you can do is that you can take the link of that particular place. I will show you how it happens. I go to some other page. I scroll down. And here I will inspect the ID of this page. This is the ID of this page. So I will copy this in this ID. And if I put here the hashtag and this ID. Now I will enter. So it will directly take me here. In ICDA 8. So if I put it in incognito. It will scroll me and show that particular ID. It will show me. It will scroll me. Instead of showing me this. It has scrolled me. Because it wants to take me to this ID. So it works in linking. So it is an ID. Keep this in mind. You will know that many people can generate links. If you write an ID in any of the links. When you open that link. You will see the same ID. Like in this case. You can see that as soon as I enter. So maybe I have wronged the ID here. But you got the point. You got the point. 29.29. And I will enter it. So you see I have come down. I will open incognito. Or reload it. So you see I have come down. I will scroll it. And after that I will open a new tab. And I will do this. Look I am scrolling it. And it is taking me to the page. This ID is on which page. So I hope you have understood the ID and the classes. From the video. The ID means like the basic card. Class means that one person's property. Like he likes red. Or which class he is in. One element can be given multiple classes. One element can be red color. And the other element can be red. And the background can be yellow. So red class can be given multiple classes. You can give red class to a fake element. And you can give red class to a fake element. And you can give yellow class to a fake element. So I hope you have understood. So that's all for now. I was reading captions. And I got a laugh. I read captions. So I told him that the land of the village is my name. And I heard this thing. I laughed 5-10 times. It was very tasty. I said to access name your village land. Mine. So on this, access the playlist. Access the GitHub. Like the video. Keep it up. In the comments section, write the hashtag sigma batch op. Thank you so much for watching this video. And I will see you next time. ."}
