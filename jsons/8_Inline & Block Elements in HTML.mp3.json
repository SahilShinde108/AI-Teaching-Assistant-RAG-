{"number": "8", "title": "Inline & Block Elements in HTML", "start": 642.0, "end": 643.0, "text": " Bye."}], "text": " Learning the concept of Inline and Block Elements in HTML is very important. Inline Elements are those which are required to take the width of the screen. And Block Elements are those which take the entire width of the screen. It is also called Display Property which can be set through CSS. If you are enjoying this video so far, then do like this video. So let's go to the computer screen and look closely at Inline and Block Elements. Through some very good examples, let's roll the intro. So guys, we are done with Inline and Block Elements. If you haven't accessed the playlist and haven't accessed the code, then access both. Because as the videos are being made, the code and our video are being added to the playlist. Now I will quickly make a folder called Video 8. I have already added 7 videos here by doing a new folder. I will make a video 8 here and open it in the VS Code. After opening it, I will tell you about the index and block elements by closing the index. I entered the description and typed it. But I will not do it because I can do it when I type it. I will write here Inline and Block Elements. I had told you a little about this. But I will add more details to it and tell you what are Inline Elements and why I want to use them. So see, Inline Elements are those elements which take only the width of the screen. Do block elements take only the width of the screen? No, they say we need the entire width. They say it is our entire width. Some people just sit with the screen. They are the only ones who have block elements. I will tell you what is the difference between them. To explain this difference, I will cheat here. The cheating is that I will add CSS. You might say I have not studied CSS, why are you adding CSS? I am adding CSS only as much as is necessary. And here I will just do one thing. I will write P and enter here. Let us say I am a Para. I will say give P as background color. Let us say blue. I will give you a good color choice. Now you can see that I have given you a color. And along with that I will add anchor tag. HFS will be equal to gold.com. I will have to add stdps. Stdps. That is why it will be equal to gold.com. And I will write here Google. And the anchor tag, I will give it in background color. I will give it background color red. But I will not do red here. And in this way, I can choose any color in the spectrum. How did you like the Ninja Tagging? If you already know Ninja Tagging, then comment. I will already go to sleep. You should definitely comment on this. It is very important. Now you can see here, I have given the background color of the anchor tag. And I have done it very similar. I will change it a little. I will do it a little reddish. I have done it towards red orange. And I have done it blue. Now you see the difference. I will click here. And as soon as I click here, you see that the background color is the whole width. But it is only as much as the element is. Why did this happen? It happened because this is a paragraph block element. And our anchor tag is inline element. Inline elements only take as much as they want. Block elements take the whole width. And the next content comes below them. When they take the whole width, then the next content will come below them. Along with that, if I talk about div, what is that? A block element. I am a block element. And span is like div. But it is an inline element. I am span and I am inline. And after that, if I click on the anchor tag and write yes, he is inline. So you see here, what happened? I will show you the code. So if I write it in the new line. By the way, I will tell you how many spaces I will give here. This will not be in my content. Because HTML is more than one space. It does not include it anyway. If you want to give spaces, then you can write here. I will tell you about it. But now I want to show you how it works. So see what happened? I wrote here that this is IMA paragraph. What is the paragraph? A block element. So I took the whole width. The next content will come down. I wrote this as href is equal to this. So I took as much width as it is necessary. And took as much width as it is necessary. But the next content was saying that I want the whole width. So it will not come here. It will come in the next line. Because it says that I want the whole width. So it will come in the next line. It cannot come in this line. Because how will it come in this line? Google is also taking it. So it will take the whole width. If I give it a background color, then it will be in the whole width. I will do the work. I give it a yellow color. It has a background color. And I give it a yellow background color. And you see here, this yellow took the whole width. Along with that, I can keep the span and anchor tag in one line. Because it is an inline element. So the only width is given with the inline element. And in its own width, it gives the opportunity to come in other elements. Like you have seen here that this span also gave the opportunity to come in anchor tag. Now will the anchor tag be inline? Will the paragraph tag always be blocked? Will this thing always be? The answer is no. You can change it. You can set a particular element of the display property of the CSS. And if you set the display property, then it is not necessary that the inline will be blocked. The inline element and the block element will be blocked. We will see this in the CSS. Now I would like to pinpoint one thing quickly. The video of Forms was video 7. But I have put it in the folder called video 6. So I will do video 7. And now the video 8. What we are doing now is video 8. And nothing is in video 7. So I will quickly structure it here. Don't worry about it. I hope you are getting a lot of learnings. A lot of people have pointed this thing in the comments. I will fix it. But I think that doesn't affect us in any way. Because you are getting it. And the folder you will get now, the source code of the notes, You will get it absolutely right. Along with that, go to codewithary.com and download the notes. And that will be a complementary source for you. But I am explaining everything to you. Step by step. So don't worry about it. Okay, so this is our inline and block elements. Now which elements are inline and which blocks are inline. How will you know? How will you know that div is a block and span is inline. So this comes with practice. But I have made a list of inline and block elements for you. Here, this is the list of block elements. In which I have written the most commonly used elements. Like div is used the most. Then it is a paragraph. And if you come to the end, you will get such elements. Which may not be used a lot. Maybe you don't even know about them. But you will know later. And tell all the elements that are not possible for me. So you do some self-learning. Definitely there are a lot of such elements. Which will come in very less use. But the most commonly used ones will show you. Then I have made a complete list of inline elements. So you refer this comprehensive list. Here I have made a file in the name of comprehensive list.txt. And you should not have any false space in the code. I told you that there are no parts in it. In fact, if you write and document, your document will be in format. Write the code well. Write the code that your grandson opens your laptop and sees it. And if they get this code, they will say that grandfather used to write a good code. They will not say that grandfather used to put such a space. Then grandfather used to do this and that. So you will want that you should write in good words. So write the code well. So that your grandson can hear you very good things. Now here I want to give you a quiz through HTML comments. And this quiz is that without using BR tag, write a vertical or a line form. Asking for name city. And here I have added one more thing. I will show you. I will turn on the word wrap. Now look here, name city and pin code of a user. So write a form. Because in the last video, we had read about form. You have to write this form. How will you make it? You should know. And along with that, I want everyone to answer this question in the comment section. Everyone. This is our first quiz. So I want you to write two interactions. Do write your code in the comment section. Do comment. And tell me which element you used. The online element of if yes, which online element of block element. I can tell you in the explanation comment section. In the upcoming videos, we will also see that using CSS, How can you set inline flex, inline block, Displaced property like this. And what difference does it make. So we will see all these things in the upcoming videos. I want to tell you that if you are following this course, You will be a great web developer. And don't think that the videos are long. And our progress is going on for a long time. And all that. I want to be beginner friendly with the courses. Whatever I am making courses. And along with that, I want to tell you this. I want to tell you in life that you are doing this. We are having fun. You are studying. You are doing this. You are doing this. Do you know what is the thing that people will never say to you. That is that you are blessed. No one will tell you that you got a course in the course of Sigma web development. You are living at a time in which you get such a comprehensive course In Hindi and Hindi. No one will tell you that you are blessed. People will say that I am going to watch a movie. I am going to watch this. You are studying. What is it? You mean that you are so boring. People will tell you this. But no one will tell you that you are blessed to find this course. And you are blessed that you are watching. You are blessed that you are not distracted. And in the coming time, when you look back, You will realize that you are blessed. I myself say that I am blessed. I studied at the time of IITJ. I took out IITJ. So much happened. Everything changed. So you will not tell you this. No one will tell you that it is worth the sacrifice that you are doing. I am telling you that whatever people have got success in life, They have sacrificed. Take any name of anyone. They have sacrificed somewhere. They have made a big sacrifice. And people will never tell you that this sacrifice is worth it. So you keep working hard. You are going right. Don't think that you are missing out. You are missing out. Everything is won. I had to get this advice. This note is Rs. 4-5,000. Which I did not get. But it's okay. Let's move forward. I will do one thing. I will add a color to the span. I will write here span. And here I will add background color. I will add any color. I will add blue violet. I will reduce it a little. I will click and hover. Like this. And if you see here, it has highlighted it like this. So for now, I hope you have understood what the difference is on the inline of block elements. Like the video.
